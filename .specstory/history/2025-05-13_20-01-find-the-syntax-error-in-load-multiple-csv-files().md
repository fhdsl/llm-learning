# Find the syntax error in load_multiple_csv_files() (2025-05-13 13:01:10)

Find the syntax error in load_multiple_csv_files() - why is my function not loading in the data?

---

Your function has two syntax errors:

1. **Misspelled `import` statement**: The keyword `import` is misspelled as `inport`. This will cause a syntax error at the very beginning of the script.

2. **Incorrect indentation in the `try` block**: The `data = pd.read_csv(file_path)` line inside the `try` block is not indented properly. Python requires consistent indentation for blocks of code.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def load_multiple_csv_files(file_paths):
    for file_path in file_paths:
        if file_path.endswith('.csv'):
            try:
                data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
                print(f"Loaded {file_path} with shape {data.shape}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error loading {file_path}: {e}")
        else:
            print(f"Skipping non-CSV file: {file_path}")
```

### Fixes:
1. Changed `inport` to `import`.
2. Indented the `data = pd.read_csv(file_path)` line correctly under the `try` block.

This should resolve the syntax errors and allow your function to load the data properly.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import pandas as pd  # Fixed typo in 'import'

def load_multiple_csv_files(file_paths):
    for file_path in file_paths:
        if file_path.endswith('.csv'):
            try:
                data = pd.read_csv(file_path)  # Fixed indentation of this line
                print(f"Loaded {file_path} with shape {data.shape}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error loading {file_path}: {e}")
        else:
            print(f"Skipping non-CSV file: {file_path}")
```

### Changes made:
1. Fixed the typo in `import` (changed `inport` to `import`).
2. Corrected the indentation of the `data = pd.read_csv(file_path)` line inside the `try` block.
