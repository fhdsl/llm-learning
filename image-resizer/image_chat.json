Run the script with the image file path as an argument:\n   ```bash\n   python image_resizer.py path/to/your/image.jpg\n   ```\n\nReplace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the actual path to the image you want to resize. The resized image will be saved in the same directory as the original image with `_small` appended to the file name."
