# Image resizing function in Python (2025-05-13 08:23:32)

_**User**_

Create a python function that resizes an image to 100 x 100 pixels. It should use a file path as an input, and work with common graphic formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, and more). The function should output a PNG file in the same location, use the suffix "small" in the file name

---

_**Assistant**_

Here is a Python function that resizes an image to 100x100 pixels using the `Pillow` library:

```python
from PIL import Image
import os

def resize_image_to_100x100(image_path):
    """
    Resizes an image to 100x100 pixels and saves it as a PNG file
    with '_small' appended to the original file name.

    Args:
        image_path (str): The file path of the image to resize.
    """
    try:
        # Open the image
        with Image.open(image_path) as img:
            # Resize the image
            img_resized = img.resize((100, 100))

            # Get the file name and directory
            base, ext = os.path.splitext(image_path)
            output_path = f"{base}_small.png"

            # Save the resized image as PNG
            img_resized.save(output_path, format="PNG")
            print(f"Resized image saved to: {output_path}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Usage
1. Install the `Pillow` library if you don't already have it:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

2. Call the function with the path to your image:
   ```python
   resize_image_to_100x100("path/to/your/image.jpg")
   ```

This function works with common image formats like PNG, JPG, GIF, etc., and saves the resized image as a PNG file with `_small` appended to the original file name.

What are the python libraries for image manipulation?

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are some popular Python libraries for image manipulation:

1. **Pillow (PIL)**  
   - A widely used library for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.
   - Supports many formats like PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, etc.
   - Install: `pip install pillow`

2. **OpenCV**  
   - A powerful library for computer vision and image processing.
   - Supports advanced operations like edge detection, object recognition, and more.
   - Install: `pip install opencv-python`

3. **scikit-image**  
   - A library built on top of NumPy, designed for image processing tasks.
   - Useful for scientific image analysis.
   - Install: `pip install scikit-image`

4. **Imageio**  
   - A library for reading and writing images in various formats, including animated GIFs.
   - Install: `pip install imageio`

5. **NumPy**  
   - While not specifically for images, it can manipulate image data as arrays.
   - Useful for pixel-level operations.
   - Install: `pip install numpy`

6. **Matplotlib**  
   - Primarily a plotting library, but it can also handle basic image manipulation and visualization.
   - Install: `pip install matplotlib`

7. **PyTorch / TensorFlow (with image modules)**  
   - These libraries are primarily for machine learning but include image manipulation utilities for preprocessing.
   - Install: `pip install torch` or `pip install tensorflow`

8. **Wand**  
   - A Python binding for ImageMagick, suitable for advanced image manipulation.
   - Install: `pip install Wand`

9. **SimpleITK**  
   - A library for image analysis, particularly in medical imaging.
   - Install: `pip install SimpleITK`

10. **PyGame**  
    - A library for game development that includes basic image manipulation features.
    - Install: `pip install pygame`

Each library has its strengths, so the choice depends on your specific use case. For general-purpose image manipulation, **Pillow** is the most commonly used.

Change `image_resizer.py` so that it preseves the dimension ratio. It should output a 100 px width image

---

_**Assistant**_

Here is the updated code for `image_resizer.py` to preserve the aspect ratio while resizing the image to a width of 100 pixels:

```python
from PIL import Image
import os

def resize_image_to_100_width(image_path):
    """
    Resizes an image to a width of 100 pixels while preserving the aspect ratio
    and saves it as a PNG file with '_small' appended to the original file name.

    Args:
        image_path (str): The file path of the image to resize.
    """
    try:
        # Open the image
        with Image.open(image_path) as img:
            # Calculate the new height to preserve the aspect ratio
            width, height = img.size
            new_width = 100
            new_height = int((new_width / width) * height)

            # Resize the image
            img_resized = img.resize((new_width, new_height))

            # Get the file name and directory
            base, ext = os.path.splitext(image_path)
            output_path = f"{base}_small.png"

            # Save the resized image as PNG
            img_resized.save(output_path, format="PNG")
            print(f"Resized image saved to: {output_path}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Aspect Ratio Calculation**: The new height is calculated based on the original aspect ratio using the formula:
   ```python
   new_height = int((new_width / width) * height)
   ```
2. **Updated Function Name**: Changed the function name to `resize_image_to_100_width` to reflect the new behavior.

### Usage:
Call the function with the path to your image:
```python
resize_image_to_100_width("path/to/your/image.jpg")
```

How do I run `resize_image_to_100_width` on the command line?

---

_**Assistant**_

To run the `resize_image_to_100_width` function from the command line, you can modify your script to allow it to accept a file path as a command-line argument. Here's how you can update your script:

### Updated Script
Add the following code at the bottom of your `image_resizer.py` file:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys

    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python image_resizer.py <image_path>")
    else:
        image_path = sys.argv[1]
        resize_image_to_100_width(image_path)
```

### Steps to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `image_resizer.py`:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/tladera2/Code/llm-learning
   ```

2. Run the script with the image file path as an argument:
   ```bash
   python image_resizer.py path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the actual path to the image you want to resize. The resized image will be saved in the same directory as the original image with `_small` appended to the file name.
